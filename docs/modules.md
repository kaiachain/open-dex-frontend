### Core

The `core` contains:

- domain logic
- classes for working with Kaikas and Metamask wallets via `caver` and `ethers` providers.
- ABI (application binary interface) for Kaia-DEX smart contracts and their methods

### Modules

Each module has a specific domain and contains components, utils, store, etc. associated with this module's domain.

| Module              | Contents                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ModuleAssets`      | Functionality related to assets: listing assets, showing transaction details, and so on.                            |
| `ModuleEarnShared`  | Calculating earnings (ROI calculator).                                                                              |
| `ModuleFarming`     | Functionality related to farming pools.                                                                             |
| `ModuleGovernance`  | Governance-related functionality: proposals, voting, and so on.                                                     |
| `ModuleLiquidity`   | Liquidity-related functionality: adding and removing liquidity, viewing liquidity pairs.                            |
| `ModuleStaking`     | Functionality related to staking pools.                                                                             |
| `ModuleSwap`        | Swap-related functionality: showing details of the swap operation, confirming tokens, configuring swap preferences. |
| `ModuleTradeShared` | Functionality related to trading.                                                                                   |

### Pages

The `pages` module contains the application structure. The vue-router is created in the [`src/router.ts`](../src/router.ts) file, where it defines the application pages and hierarchy of the components. The router creation is manual.

For example, for the page with trading, the structure in `pages` is the following:

```
pages/trade
│   index.vue
│   swap.vue    
│
└───liquidity
    │   add.vue
    │   index.vue
    │   remove.vue

```
While the router defines the following route:

```ts
{
    path: '/swap',
    component: () => import('./pages/trade/index.vue'),
    children: [
    {
        name: RouteName.Swap,
        path: '',
        component: () => import('./pages/trade/swap.vue'),
    },
    {
        name: RouteName.Liquidity,
        path: '/liquidity',
        component: () => import('./pages/trade/liquidity/index.vue'),
    },
    {
        name: RouteName.LiquidityAdd,
        path: '/liquidity/add',
        component: () => import('./pages/trade/liquidity/add.vue'),
    },
    {
        name: RouteName.LiquidityRemove,
        path: '/liquidity/remove',
        component: () => import('./pages/trade/liquidity/remove.vue'),
    },
    ],
},
```

## Environment Variables

Some application parameters are defined as the environment variables via [`.env`](../.env). The expected types for these variables are defined in [`src/env.d.ts`](../src/env.d.ts).
