# Kaia-DEX Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites 

To build Kaia-DEX, you need Node.js v16 and PNPM v7 installed:

- Install Node.js v16.

  First, install Node Version Manager:
   
  ```bash
  # Install NVM itself
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

  # Run it to use NVM in the current shell session or restart your shell
  export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
  ```

  Then run:

  ```
  nvm install 16
  ```

- Install PNPM v7:
   
  ```bash
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```

## Configuration

App configuration is split into two parts: main configuration file and environment variables.

### Main configuration file

Most of application configuration should be defined in `dex-config.json` file. **This configuration is mandatory.** Its content is strictly validated before being passed into application.

The main configuration in `dex-config.json` includes:

- native and DEX tokens
- whitelisted tokens
- network configuration
- addresses of smart contracts deployed in the network
- URIs of subgraphs

The `dex-config.example.json` file contains a sample configuration used by Soramitsu in dev environment.

For more details of configuration schema, consult [`etc/vite-plugin-config.ts`](../etc/vite-plugin-config.ts).

### Configuration via Environment Variables

Some application parameters are defined as the environment variables. The expected types for these variables are defined in [`src/env.d.ts`](../src/env.d.ts). The values could be specified in `.env`, `.env.local`, other `.env*` files or directly in [user environment](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv).

You can use [`.env.example`](../.env.example) as a sample.

For more details about env variables and modes please consult [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html).


## Build without testing

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash 
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Build Kaia-DEX:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## CI/CD

The following steps install dependencies, run checks, and then build the app:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash 
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Check code formatting:
   
   ```bash
   pnpm format:check
   ```

3. Run static analysis:

   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm lint
   ```

4. Run both unit and component tests:

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

5. Build Kaia-DEX:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
